# Mr Miyagi trainee project - Instructions
## 1) prompt user for input
## 2) Evaluate each input and print the appropriate responses

### Follow these rules:
##### every time you ask a question --> Mr. Miyagi responde with
    # --> 'questions are wise, but for now. Wax on, and Wax off!'
##### every statement/question must start with Sensei, otherwise:
    # --> 'You are smart, but not wise - address me as Sensei please'
##### every time you mention 'block' or 'blocking' --> Mr. Miyagi responde with
    # --> 'Remeber, best block, not to be there..'
##### anything else you say:
    # --> 'do not lose focus. Wax on. Wax off.'
##### Make it so you keep playing until we say: 'Sensei, I am at peace'
    # --> 'Sometimes, what heart know, head forget'
